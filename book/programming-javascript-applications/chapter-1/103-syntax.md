## Syntax

The JavaScript syntax should be immediately familiar to anybody who has experience with C-family languages such as C\+\+, Java, C#, PHP, and so on. Part of JavaScript's popularity is due to its familiarity, though it's important to understand that JavaScript behaves very differently from all of these under the hood.

JavaScript’s Object Literal syntax is so simple, flexible, and concise, it was adapted to become the dominant standard for client/server communication in the form of JSON, which is more compact and flexible than the XML that it replaced.
