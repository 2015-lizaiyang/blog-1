# Chapter 1. The JavaScript Revolution

In case you haven’t heard, JavaScript is arguably the most important programming language on Earth. Once thought of as a toy, JavaScript is now the most widely deployed programming language in history. Almost everyone with a computer or a smart phone has all the tools they need to execute JavaScript programs, and create their own. All you need is a browser and a text editor.

JavaScript, HTML and CSS have become so prevalent that many operating systems have adopted the open web standards as the presentation layer for native apps. Even Microsoft announced that the Windows 8 UI will be driven by open web standards.

Creating a JavaScript program is as simple as editing a text file and opening it in the browser. No complex development environments to download and install. No complex IDE to learn. JavaScript is easy to learn, too. The basic syntax is immediately familiar to any programmer who has been exposed to the C family syntax. No other language can boast a barrier to entry as low as JavaScript.

That low barrier to entry is probably the main reason that JavaScript was once widely (perhaps rightly) shunned as a toy. It was mainly used to create UI effects in the browser. That situation has changed.

For a long time, there was no way to save data with JavaScript. If you wanted data to persist, you had to submit a form to a web server and wait for a page refresh. That hindered the process of creating responsive and dynamic web applications. However, in 2000, Microsoft started shipping Ajax technology in Internet Explorer. Soon after, other browsers added support for the XMLHttpRequest object.

In 2004, Google launched Gmail. Initially applauded because it promised users nearly infinite storage for their email, Gmail also brought a major revolution. Gone were the page refreshes. Under the hood, Gmail was taking advantage of the new Ajax technology, creating a single page, fast, responsive web application that would forever change the way that web applications are designed.

Since that time, web developers have produced nearly every type of application, including full blown cloud-based office suites (see [Zoho.com][5]), social APIs like Facebook’s JavaScript SDK, even graphically intensive video games.

JavaScript didn’t just luck into its position as the dominant client side language on the web. It is actually very well suited to be the language that took over the world. It is one of the most advanced and expressive programming languages developed to date. Here are some of the features you may or may not be familiar with:
