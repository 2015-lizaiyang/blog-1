## The Net Result

JavaScript developers are at the heart of what may be the single biggest revolution in the history of computing: the dawn of the realtime web. Messages passing back and forth across the net, in some cases with each keystroke, or every move of the mouse. We’re writing applications that put desktop application UI’s to shame. Modern JavaScript applications are the most responsive, most socially engaging applications ever written — and if you don’t know JavaScript yet, you’re missing the boat. It’s time to get on board, before you get left behind.
